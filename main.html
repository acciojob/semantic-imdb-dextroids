  <summary>summary:ancient Kahndaq, Teth Adam was bestowed the almighty powers of the gods. After using these powers for vengeance, he was imprisoned, becoming Black Adam. Nearly 5,000 years have passed, and Black Adam has gone from man to myth to legend. Now free, his unique form of justice, born out of rage, is challenged by modern-day heroes who form the Justice Society: Hawkman, Dr. Fate, Atom Smasher and Cyclone.</summary>
  <section ids="actor">About actor:Black Adam is incredibly violent and angry, so he's not really a good guy, but the only people he hurts are usually pretty nasty pieces of work. In the action movie, Black Adam kills a lot of people and doesn't exactly operate in the way you'd normally expect from your classic hero.</section>
